Apache Tomcat



Apache Tomcat is an application server from the Apache Software Foundation that executes Java servlets and renders Web pages that include Java Server Page coding.


Apache Tomcat basically make our Java Web applications to run on host and server based system and it is configured on port 8080


There are two files to load and stop tomcat
startup.sh
shutdown.sh


Important configuration files
server.xml and tomcat-users.xml

Installation


Install Java, as tomcat requires Java to run
sudo yum -y install java-1.8*
Download Tomcat
cd ~
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.94/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.94.tar.gz
 wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.92/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.92.tar.gz

Extract the tar
cd ~
tar xvf apache-tomcat-7.0.94.tar.gz
cd apache-tomcat-7.0.94/bin
./startup.sh 
Browse the app manager on http://ip-add:8080
Now Click on Manager App, it prompts for credentials, and credentials should be updated in tomcat-users.xml
Update the credentials in tomcat-users.xml




vim ~/apache-tomcat-7.0.94/conf/tomcat-users.xml
Add the following line in below <tomcat-users>
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
<user username="deploy" password="deploy" roles="manager-script"/>
Stop and start the server back
~/apache-tomcat-7.0.94/bin/shutdown.sh
~/apache-tomcat-7.0.94/bin/startup.sh
Browse the app manager on http://ip-add:8080
Now you can see the tomcat interface
